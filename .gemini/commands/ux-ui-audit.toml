**TASK: Perform a UX/UI audit.**

Please act as an expert UX/UI designer and developer. Your task is to audit the provided component code against the established design and user experience guidelines for the ARC Raiders Loot Planner project.

**UI GUIDELINES:**

@{guidelines/ux-guidelines/ui.md}

**UX GUIDELINES:**

@{guidelines/ux-guidelines/ux.md}

**COMPONENT CODE TO AUDIT:**

@{{component_file}}

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

Based on the UI and UX guidelines provided, please audit the component code.

1. **Identify any specific areas that violate the guidelines.** For each violation, cite the specific guideline that is being broken and explain why it's problematic.

2. **For each violation, cite the specific guideline** that is being broken with a direct quote or reference.

3. **Provide clear, actionable feedback and code examples for improvement.** Show specific code snippets demonstrating how to fix the issues.

4. **If the component is compliant, confirm that** and highlight how it adheres to best practices from the guidelines.

5. **Consider the following aspects in your audit:**
   - Visual design (spacing, typography, color usage, elevation)
   - Component composition and Material UI v7 patterns
   - Accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, contrast)
   - Responsive design and breakpoint handling
   - User flow and interaction patterns
   - Loading states, error states, and empty states
   - Performance considerations (memoization, lazy loading)
   - Gaming aesthetic and ARC Raiders brand alignment
   - TypeScript type safety and props design

**Structure your response clearly in Markdown.**

Use the following format:
- **Summary**: Brief overview of audit findings
- **Violations**: List of issues with guideline references
- **Recommendations**: Specific improvements with code examples
- **Strengths**: What the component does well (if applicable)
